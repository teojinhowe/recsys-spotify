This recommender system was built and is hosted on the services of S3 and Sagemaker from AWS.<br>

The dataset comprises Million Playlist Dataset (MPD) and API retrieved song meta and audio feature, both officially provided by Spotify. The MPD will not be hosted here in accordance to Spotify RecSys Challenge Terms & Condition<br>

The library Spotipy is heavily used in this system, in order to integrate Spotify's API to Jupyter Notebooks. <br>

Certain account and client details have been removed in the scripts for privacy <br>

For more information and documentation on the process and workings of this recommender system, please visit the associated Medium link provided<br>

Cheers and regards - Jin Howe
