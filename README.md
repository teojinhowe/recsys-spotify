<h3>Foreword</h3>

<li>For more walkthrough on the process and workings of this recommender system, you can read more <a href='https://medium.com/@jinator.biz/spotify-playlist-song-recsys-fd10f1d05a3b'><b><u>here</b></u></a>.</li><br>

<li>This recommender system was built and is hosted on the services of S3 and Sagemaker from AWS. I have converted ipynb files to simple python scripts for the purpose of this github repo.</li><br>

<li>The dataset comprises Million Playlist Dataset (MPD) and API retrieved song meta and audio feature, both officially provided by Spotify. The MPD will not be hosted here in accordance to Spotify RecSys Challenge Terms & Condition</li><br>

<li>The library Spotipy is heavily used in this system, in order to integrate Spotify's API to Jupyter Notebooks.</li><br>

<li>Certain account and client details have been removed in the scripts for privacy </li><br>

<li> recommender.py is the recommender engine. Execute run.py to run the recommender system and add songs to the playlist directly into the Spotify app (if authentication provided).</li><br>
